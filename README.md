# 🌦️ Weather Data Analysis – Power BI Dashboard  

This project is a result of my consistent learning and practice in **Power BI and Data Analytics**.  
I created this dashboard to study **weather data from 2021 to 2024**, focusing on how temperature, rainfall, and humidity change across different months and seasons.  
My goal was to make complex weather data easy to understand through clear visuals and meaningful insights.

---

## 📊 Project Overview
I worked on cleaning and combining multiple CSV files using **Power Query Editor** and transformed them into a single clean dataset.  
Then, I built an interactive **Power BI dashboard** where users can explore year-wise and month-wise climate patterns.  
I also created **custom DAX measures and KPIs** such as:
- Average Temperature  
- Total Rainfall  
- Year-over-Year Climate Comparison  

The dashboard allows viewers to easily switch between years, seasons, and weather parameters using slicers and filters.

## 🧠 What I Learned & Discovered
- How to use **Power BI** for analyzing multi-year data in a professional format.  
- The importance of **data cleaning and transformation** before visualization.  
- Identified **patterns in temperature and rainfall** that change with seasons.  
- Gained hands-on experience with **DAX formulas** and **interactive dashboard design**.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Power BI** for dashboard design and analytics  
- **Power Query Editor** for data transformation  
- **DAX** for custom measures  
- **Excel (CSV)** for initial data storage and validation
